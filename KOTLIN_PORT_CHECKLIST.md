## Next Steps

With foundational memory management, data access, and initial quantization types (Q8_0, Q4_0, Q4_1) in place, the immediate priorities are:

1.  **Advance Quantization Support:**
    *   Implement a K-Quant type (e.g., Q4_K or Q2_K), including its structure, accessors, quant/dequant routines.
    *   Implement optimized dot product routines for symmetric cases (e.g., F32 x Q_type for Q8_0, Q4_0, Q4_1) and for new K-Quant types.
    *   Test quantization accuracy for all newly supported types (e.g., Q4_1 accuracy test is pending).

2.  **Strengthen Core Operations and Testing:**
    *   Implement and write unit tests for remaining core tensor operations in `GGMLComputeOps.kt` (e.g., common activation functions like SILU; normalization layers like RMSNorm) for F32/F16 types. (Note: GELU/RELU tests were planned next).
    *   Ensure all basic compute operations have proper handling or clear strategies for all fundamental (non-quantized) data types (I8, I32, I64).
    *   Begin work on "Implement graph optimization" from Phase 2.

3.  **Initiate CPU Backend Development (Phase 3):**
    *   Formalize the CPU backend structure.
    *   Start integrating current `GGMLComputeOps.kt` logic into this backend.
    *   Investigate and implement initial multi-threading for graph computation on CPU.

4.  **Begin Foundational GGUF Support (Phase 6):**
    *   Start implementing GGUF file parsing (reading headers, tensor info, quantization types). This is crucial for loading models.

5.  **(Stretch Goal / Parallel) Initial Metal Backend Exploration (Phase 4):**
    *   Begin basic Metal context setup and experiment with compiling/running a simple Metal compute shader for a single ggml operation.

## Build Environment

The project is set up as a Kotlin Multiplatform project with the following structure:

- **Root Directory**: /Volumes/stuff/Projects/SolaceCore/tmp/llama.kotlin
- **Source Directory**: src/nativeMain/kotlin/ai/solace/llamakotlin
- **Build Configuration**: build.gradle.kts, settings.gradle.kts
- **Design Documents**: TENSOR_OPERATIONS_DESIGN.md, GGML_COMPUTE_OPS_DESIGN.md
- **Status Document**: KOTLIN_PORT_STATUS.md

The project targets macOS platforms (both x64 and arm64) and uses Gradle for building. The entry point for the application is defined as "ai.solace.llamakotlin.main".

Note: C/C++ build files (CMakeLists.txt, CMakePresets.json, Makefile) and non-Kotlin related build tools (cmake directory) have been moved to the archive/build-tools folder. GPU backends (CUDA, SYCL, Vulkan, etc.) have been moved to the archive folder. Instead of symbolic links, actual copies of header files are used in the spm-headers directory for Windows compatibility.

## Challenges and Considerations

Some key challenges and considerations for the Kotlin Native port:

1. **Memory Management**: Kotlin Native has a different memory model than C++, which will require careful design for efficient tensor operations
2. **Performance**: Ensuring that the Kotlin implementation maintains comparable performance to the C++ original
3. **Interoperability**: Potentially allowing interoperability with the original C++ code for components that are difficult to port
4. **Metal Integration**: Implementing the Metal backend for Apple Silicon optimization
5. **Quantization**: Implementing efficient quantization support in Kotlin Native
