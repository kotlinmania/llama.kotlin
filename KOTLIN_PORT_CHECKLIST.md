# LLama.cpp Kotlin Native Port - Detailed Checklist

This checklist is based on the current state of the Kotlin Native port of llama.cpp and the requirements specified in the issue description. It provides a detailed roadmap for continuing the development of the port.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL BUILD STATUS (Updated: December 2025)

**Current Status: BUILD FAILING**

The project currently does not compile due to klang integration issues:

- **KLang Integration**: klang is now a separate repository at https://github.com/Kotlinmania/klang
- **Package Naming Conflicts**: Vendored klang sources in `external/klangnative/` have internal package naming inconsistencies
- **Affected Modules**: Core quantization, GGML compute operations, backend implementations
- **Action Required**: Fix klang integration (publish as library, fix vendored sources, or use submodule)

See `CHECKLIST_UPDATE_NOTES.md` for detailed analysis.

## Phase 2.5: KLang Soft‑Float + Wide Integer Backbone (Integration Issues)

⚠️ **CRITICAL**: KLang is now a separate repository at https://github.com/Kotlinmania/klang

### Current Integration Status
- [ ] **BLOCKED**: Resolve klang integration strategy
  - Current: Vendored sources in `external/klangnative/` with package naming conflicts
  - Options: 
    1. Publish klang as Maven/Gradle library
    2. Use git submodule
    3. Fix vendored source package names
- [ ] **BLOCKED**: Fix package naming inconsistencies
  - llama.kotlin imports `ai.solace.klangnative.*`
  - Vendored klang has mixed `ai.solace.klang.*` and `ai.solace.klangnative.*`
- [ ] **BLOCKED**: Remove duplicate klang sources
  - Removed from `src/commonMain/kotlin/ai/solace/klang/` (December 2025)
  - Need to verify external sources are authoritative

### KLang Features (When Integration Fixed)

We introduced a portable, pure‑Kotlin numeric core to remove cross‑platform float drift and make SIMD/GPU backends optional rather than required for correctness.

- [x] KLang namespace and modules
  - [x] `ai.solace.klangnative.fp`: `CFloat32` (inline) with operators +, −, ×, ÷ delegating to bit‑exact soft‑float
  - [x] `ai.solace.klangnative.bitwise.Float32Math`: transliterations of compiler‑rt float32 builtins
    - [x] Division: faithful `fp_div_impl.inc` (normalize, quotient bounds, remainder→sticky, nearest‑even)
    - [ ] Multiplication: tighten to `fp_mul_impl.inc` (currently functional, not yet bit‑diff clean on all ties)
    - [ ] Square root: implement `fp_sqrt_impl.inc`
    - [ ] Conversions: int/uint ↔ float32; float32 ↔ float64
  - [x] Float-on-LHS operators (`Float +/-/*// CFloat32`)
- [x] 16‑bit limb engine for exact 128‑bit intermediates
  - [x] `ai.solace.klangnative.int.hpc.HPC16x4` (64‑bit, 4×16‑bit limbs): add/sub/compare/shifts
  - [x] `ai.solace.klangnative.int.hpc.HPC16x8` (128‑bit, 8×16‑bit limbs): add/sub/compare/shifts, initial 64×64→128 mul
  - [ ] 128/64 division (Knuth D) and full carry propagation for wide mul
- [ ] Float64 roadmap (compiler‑rt exactness)
  - [ ] Port add/sub/mul/div/sqrt using HPC16x4/x8 where 128‑bit ints are required
  - [ ] Conversions: {i32,u32,i64,u64} ↔ float64; float32 ↔ float64
- [ ] Float16/BFloat16 roadmap
  - [ ] `CFloat16` (binary16) add/sub/mul/div/sqrt + conversions
  - [ ] `CBF16` bfloat16 exact conversions (ties‑to‑even) + arithmetic

Testing status (Sep 20–21, 2025)
- [x] Targeted green: `Float32DivTest`, `FloatKlangExtensionsTest` (Float on LHS), `HPC16xTests`
- [ ] Pending: full `mulBits`/`sqrtBits` suites and Float64/Float16/BF16 coverage

Why this matters now
- Eliminates subdeterministic float drift (esp. quantization math) before SIMD/GPU paths

## Next Steps

With the shared klang primitives in place, the remaining work focuses on merge-dev parity, refreshed validation, and staging the backends. Immediate priorities:

1.  **Merge-Dev Quantization Parity**
    *   Migrate Q5_K/Q6_K (and any remaining K-Quant paths) to `QuantizationHelper`, matching `get_scale_min_k4`, signed scales, and high-bit packing.
    *   Update `GGMLTypes` accessors to use `BitPrimitives`/`PackOps` so read/write paths match the C layout.
    *   Mirror `ggml_bitnet_transform_tensor` (LUT + bias) so BitNet blocks are byte-identical before matmul.

2.  **Fixture & Test Regeneration**
    *   Generate golden K-Quant/BitNet blocks from the merge-dev C reference and add byte-for-byte regression tests.
    *   Re-enable `macosArm64Test` (and other native suites) using the refreshed fixtures.

3.  **Documentation & Checklist**
    *   Update quantization/bitwise design docs and `KOTLIN_PORT_STATUS.md` to reflect parity progress and new helper modules.
    *   Keep this checklist in sync after each milestone and add any additional helper documentation as needed.

4.  **Backend Enablement**
    *   Resume CPU backend formalization (threading/SIMD) once quantizer parity is complete.
    *   Stage the GGUF parsing refresh so model loading consumes the corrected tensor layouts.

## Build Environment

The project is set up as a Kotlin Multiplatform project with the following structure:

- **Root Directory**: /Volumes/stuff/Projects/llama.kotlin
- **Source Directory**: src/nativeMain/kotlin/ai/solace/llamakotlin
- **Build Configuration**: build.gradle.kts, settings.gradle.kts
- **Design Documents**: TENSOR_OPERATIONS_DESIGN.md, GGML_COMPUTE_OPS_DESIGN.md, GGUF_IMPLEMENTATION.md (in progress)
- **Status Document**: KOTLIN_PORT_STATUS.md

The project targets macOS platforms (both x64 and arm64) and uses Gradle for building. Key commands: `./gradlew build -x macosArm64Test` (current green) and `./gradlew macosArm64Test` (failing until fixtures are regenerated).

Note: All legacy llama.cpp archives, GPU backends, and examples were removed in October 2025. The repo now retains only the Kotlin/Native sources, runtimes under `external/`, klang in `src/commonMain/kotlin/ai/solace/klang`, and header snapshots in `spm-headers/` for archival reference (e.g., potential Swift/Metal integration later).

## Challenges and Considerations

Some key challenges and considerations for the Kotlin Native port:

1. **Memory Management**: Kotlin Native has a different memory model than C++, which will require careful design for efficient tensor operations
2. **Performance**: Ensuring that the Kotlin implementation maintains comparable performance to the C++ original
3. **Interoperability**: Potentially allowing interoperability with the original C++ code for components that are difficult to port
4. **Future Accelerator Integration**: Evaluate GPU/SIMD backends once the CPU path is fully validated
5. **Quantization**: Implementing efficient quantization support in Kotlin Native
